      "content":  "He had to face hardship right from his childhood as his parents were very poor. He seemed to have an aim of life from his early childhood. Perhaps, for this reason, he was able to get through the myriads of problems in life. His school life began in 1963 at the village L.P School named Mokorapara L.P. School. He completed the L.P. School stage with a merit scholarship in 1968. The epigrammatic expression child is the father of man can be applicable in the life of UN. Brahma. Some traits of his future personality clearly manifested when he was in M.E. and L.P Schools. He used to deliver speeches in English when he was reading in M.E. School. The ideas he ventilated in those meetings were very advanced. He completed his M.E. stage fronm Dotma M.E. School. Then he went to Sakti Ashram for studying High School stage. He passed matric in first division with letters in General and Advanced Mathematics.",
